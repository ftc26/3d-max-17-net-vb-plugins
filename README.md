# 3d-max-17-net-vb-plugins
since the net in maxx is porly  documented with examples ,with 2 weeks of tinkering testing,no idea what i was doing, i managed to implement 4 plugins, shader,a renderer,utility and a menu, using both max dll, and that new adapter thingy, its far from ready but it  shows how to do it roughly :)
